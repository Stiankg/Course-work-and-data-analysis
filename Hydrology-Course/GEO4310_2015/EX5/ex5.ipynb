    "Vägverket (the Swedish Road Administration) plans to build a new bridge and they ask you to provide some information about the frequency and magnitude of the discharges in the river. Of course, you are a very careful consultant, so you are going to apply different statistical methods. Yearly peak flows can be found in the file Qyearly.dat.\n",
