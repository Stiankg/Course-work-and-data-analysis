    "Some precipitation stations may have short breaks in the records because of absence of the observer or because of instrumental failures. It is often necessary to estimate this missing record. The missing precipitation of a station is estimated from the observations of precipitation at some other stations as close to and as evenly spaced around the station with the missing record as possible. The station whose data is missing is called interpolation station and gauging stations whose data are used to calculate the missing station data are called index stations.\n",
