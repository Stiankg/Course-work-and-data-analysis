    "A rating curve describes the relationship between discharge and water stage. When the water stage is high, the discharge is high. When the water stage is 0, the discharge is 0. Therefore, the rating curve starts at the point (0,0). \n",
    "\n",
    "The rating curve is made by measuring water flow and water stages at the same point in time. This happens maybe once a year, so it takes a long time to accumulate many points to the curve. When the curve has some points (more than 3, and preferably more than 10) a curve fitted to the points is made. \n",

    "Next problem is the water stage, which can be expressed in absolute height (i.e. in terms of altitude [m]). However, we are interested in local water stages. To find this you must subtract the leveling point from the water stages. You have to subtract this number from all the measurements of local water stages before plotting. \n"
