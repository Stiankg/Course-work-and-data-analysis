Then add another independent variable, and make sure that this second independent variable should have the higher partial correlation with the dependent while the influence of the first independent variable is removed. Continue this procedure to see if the addition of a third independent variable will be helpful. In a standard multiple regression, all the independent variables are used in the regression model.

If there are any, remove them from the model and redo the regression with only the significant independent variables.\n",
